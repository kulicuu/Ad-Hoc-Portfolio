## Software:

### Some very recent Vulkan/Rust work:

https://github.com/kulicuu/ray-pere-nov

### Some inane React stuff for a job test:
https://github.com/kulicuu/Pokedex

### Way older and not very impressive stuff I did with Rust and Vulkano.

https://github.com/kulicuu/Peregrine

### A problem 23 in section 5 of Donald Knuth's "The Art[...]".  I did this six years ago.

https://github.com/kulicuu/puzzles_algorithms_andCetera/tree/master/knuth's_art/vol_3

### A very old unfinished graph structure visualizer that was inspired by a project implementing an autocomplete from a dictionary.

https://github.com/kulicuu/graph_radar

The autocomplete prefix-tree data-structure is found in https://github.com/kulicuu/graph_radar/tree/master/server-side/prefix_tree

https://github.com/kulicuu/MineSweeper
Not maintained. Six years old. A MineSweeper implementation I did with pure SVG and React.



## Writings:

### Papers on the Terebinth website.


#### "Engineering Critical Network Applications:"

[https://terebinth.is/pdf/CriticalSystems2001.pdf]("Engineering Critical Network Applications:")

Draft-quality.
This paper criticises typical industry dev-ops and testing practices, including the pyramid of testing paradigm associated iirc with Martin Fowler.  Proposes a new interpretation of TestDrivenDevelopment(TDD) that aims to build the 'failing-test' for the entire application instead of relying on suites of unit-tests.  The macro-level test can be typically be implemented as a bot-net attacking the candidate system.  Bot-Net in this context is synonymous with network-simulation.  There is some detailed discussion of implications in the infrastructure, such as that the bots are 90% code-identical with network clients(producers also, though initially in this paradigm we think of the producers as the candidate system, already represented.  Of course full generalization merges all into network nodes of varying properties.)


#### "Idle Speculations on the MiG-35's Operational Concept":
[https://terebinth.is/pdf/MiG__35__Paper__846400.pdf](https://terebinth.is/pdf/MiG__35__Paper__846400.pdf)
Draft quality.
Not computer-science relevant except maybe in the network-warfare facet of the multi-disciplinary enquiry.


### Some stuff that remains on GitHub Gist
#### "Foundations of Discourse."
[https://gist.github.com/kulicuu/98131e9569f74bc8fc81f5cc42eb4c97](https://gist.github.com/kulicuu/98131e9569f74bc8fc81f5cc42eb4c97)
Super rough-draft quality:
Pompous title but that is the motivation -- to grasp essentially and generally: "rigor", in sciences, arts, philosophy; discourse in any of these.  In engineering we're mostly interested in scientific rigour.  It's a poorly written draft I need to edit and rewrite somewhat. Neglected, but has some good content.


#### Grand-Unified-Theory of Software Engineering:
Kind of a dumb little piece I wrote half in jest -- at least the title.  The proposition is valid, a truism, not very useful:  Software has at most two responsibilities: these are (1) state-management, and (2) effects-propagation.  A so-called "stateless-server" would be said to have only responsibilites of effects-propagation.  This is a true statement I think, not very useful in the sense that effects-propagation applications cover infinite real-world domains and are not trivial -- e.g. ray-tracing graphics computation.  Nevertheless, for typical user-applications, this can be a good way to divide computational responsibilites, as seen in React/Flux/Redux which modularizes and isolates state-management.  Functional-programming paradigm.
